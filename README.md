# Particle LVGL Eink Example

This repository is a reference project for how to run LVGL on a Particle device. It uses an [Adafruit SSD1680 E-Ink display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4195) and a [Particle Boron404X](https://store.particle.io/products/boron-lte-cat-m1-noram-with-ethersim-4th-gen). In theory, any Particle board should work with this example.
